# Matrix Color Change React App

This project is a simple React application that creates a 3x3 matrix. Each box in the matrix changes its color to green when clicked. When the last box (bottom-right corner) is clicked, all previously clicked boxes change their color to orange in the order they were clicked. A reset button is also provided to refresh the page and reset the matrix.

## Features

- Click on any box to change its color to green.
- When the last box is clicked, all colors change to orange in the order they were clicked.
- Reset button to refresh the page and reset the matrix.
